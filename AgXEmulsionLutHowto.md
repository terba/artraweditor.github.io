# Spectral film simulations in ART with *agx-emulsion*

*(contributed by Leopoldo Saggin and Sébastien Guyader)*

Recently [*arctic*](https://discuss.pixls.us/u/arctic/summary) released [***agx-emulsion***](https://github.com/andreavolpato/agx-emulsion), a physics-based simulation of color film photography processing.

[Alberto Griggio](https://discuss.pixls.us/u/agriggio) decided to extend [**ART**](https://artraweditor.github.io/) and make possible to integrate *agx-emulsion* as an additional type of **3dLUT**, similarly in concept to what is already possible with *CTL scripts*.

Here, we describe the *installation of agx-emulsion* and its *integration in ART* using **Microsoft Windows, MacOS** and **Linux** so you can play with it, in case you are interested.

## 1. Installing *pipx* and *virtualenv* {#virtualenv-install}

Since *agx-emulsion* relies on Python, the use of a virtual environment for Python is recommended. Here we will describe how to install and use `virtualenv` which is a fast, cross-platform tool for managing isolated Python environments which allow installing and running different versions of Python.

In case you don't have Python installed already, install a recent version (from <https://www.python.org/> for example). If your Python version is \< 3.8, please update.

**Note for Windows users:** it seems like the current version of Python at the time of writing (version 3.14) prevents installing Python 3.11 from the `virtualenv`. It is suggested to directly install Python 3.11 as the main Python version on your system.

Now you can install `pipx` for your OS from here: <https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/>.

To install *virtualenv*, run the following commands in a terminal (for Windows, **cmd.exe** or **PowerShell**):

```         
pipx install virtualenv
pipx ensurepath
```

Now close your terminal window, open a new terminal and create the virtual environment for *agx-emulsion*.

For Windows:

```         
virtualenv --python 3.11 c:\users\<username>\envs\agx-emulsion
```

For MacOS/Linux:

```         
virtualenv --python 3.11 ~\envs\agx-emulsion
```

This will create a new `envs` folder in your home user directory, of course you can change it to the path/forlder name you like but don't forget to update the following commands.

## 2. Installing and preparing *agx-emulsion* {#agx-emulsion-install}

### **Activating the *agx-emulsion*** environment

For **Windows**:

-    if you use **cmd.exe** type:

```         
c:\users\<username>\envs\Scripts\activate.bat
```

-   if you use **PowerShell**:

```         
c:\users\<username>\envs\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

For **MacOS/Linux**:

```         
source ~/envs/agx-emulsion/bin/activate
```

Once the agx-emulsion environment is activated, you will see `(agx-emulsion)` displayed in the command prompt.

### **Dowloading the *agx-emulsion*** **code**

If *Git* is installed on your operating system, clone the *agx-emulsion* repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/andreavolpato/agx-emulsion.git /path/to/local/agx-emulsion
```

Otherwise you can manually download a zip/tarball snapshot of *agx-emulsion* from its [github repository](https://github.com/andreavolpato/agx-emulsion/), and extract its content to `/path/to/local/agx-emulsion`.

### Installing *agx-emulsion*

With the `(agx-emusion)` environment active in your terminal, type:

``` bash
cd /path/to/local/agx-emulsion
pip install -e .
```

And launch the GUI:

``` bash
agx-emulsion
```

If everything went well, a window should pop up which will let you experiment with *agx-emulsion*. For instance, you can load the provided test image (located in `/path/to/local/agx-emulsion/img/test`) or any image of your choice and play with the film and print emulsions to ensure the module works.

## 3. *agx-emulsion* integration in ART {#agx-emusion-art-integration}

Integration of *agx-emulsion* in ART has started since [commit 22fe47d](https://github.com/artraweditor/ART/commit/22fe47d2a4b5f72c7895ddd0cf7cfddaaabf3cfe) and is available since [release 1.25.3](https://github.com/artraweditor/ART/releases/tag/1.25.3).

In order to use the module in ART, download the support scripts:

[ART_agx_film.json](https://github.com/artraweditor/ART/raw/refs/heads/master/tools/extlut/ART_agx_film.json)

[agx_emulsion_mklut.py](https://github.com/artraweditor/ART/raw/refs/heads/master/tools/extlut/agx_emulsion_mklut.py)

and save them *both in the same directory* of your choice. **It is crucial that both files reside in the same directory**.

***Note:*** the most convenient place to save both files is the 3D LUT directory declared in ART's **Preferences \> Image Processing \> Directories \> CLUT directory**.

***ART_agx_film.json*** is a configuration file which sets the Python command to run the script ***agx_emulsion_mklut.py***. By default the command is:

``` json
    "command" : "python3 agx_emulsion_mklut.py --server",
```

Since the actual command depends on your operating system and Python install environment, you need to open it with a text editor and edit **line 12** to point to the *Python interpreter* you used to install *agx-emulsion*.

If you followed the instructions above to install *virtualenv* and Python 3.11, you will need to update this command with:

(for Windows)

``` json
    "command" : "C:\\users\\<username>\\envs\\agx-emulsion\\bin\\python agx_emulsion_mklut.py --server",
```

(for Linux and MacOS)

``` json
    "command" : "/home/<username>/envs/agx-emulsion/bin/python agx_emulsion_mklut.py --server",
```

and save the file. Please also note the presence of a "**comma**" at the end of the line!

Now when you restart ART you should be able to load ***ART_agx_film.json*** as a **LUT** from the "*Color/Tone Correction*" tool in the "Local editing" tab, or from the "Film Simulation" tool in the "Special Effects" tab.

At this point you can test if everything works:

1.  Open an image in ART
2.  Activate the "*Color/Tone Correction*" tool and, from its "*Mode"* dropdown menu select **LUT** (note that default mode is generally *Standard* or *Perceptual*)
3.  The program will ask for a *LUT file*
4.  Select ***ART_agx_film.json***
5.  At this point a large set of parameters appears, as reported in the image below, and you can play and choose the film simulation you wish to simulate etc...

## 4. Updating *agx-emulsion* {#agx-emulsion-updating}

In order to keep both the ***agx-emulsion*** Python code base and its support in ART up to date:

1.  update your local agx-emulsion repo (though *git* or by extracting a zip/tarball) and refer to the second command in the [agx-emulsion section](#agx-emulsion-installation) above
2.  download the ***agx_emulsion_mklut.py*** and ***ART_agx_film.json*** files from <https://github.com/artraweditor/ART/tree/master/tools/extlut> again, and replace the existing files in ART's **CLUT directory** with the new ones.
